# Not implemented:
#  Cannot re-use an include for a different purpose with diffently numbered
#  identifiers. Not liking the idea of requiring copying such things.
#  Also not liking the idea of specifying the identifier range when included as
#  that would also need copied
#  Might be best to just accept this and give each include a unique name that
#  includes something like ARC1-8 so one knows those are in it
#
# Not sure how ot deal with things like two vs 4 cylinders.
#   Different template?
#   Disable options, tho still not way to disable parts of a gang
#
# disable individual gauges in a gang
# enable/disable states
# completing adding options for all defined items
# Cleanup files no longer needed since preferences takes care of their needs now


# Do not edit this file
# edit preferences.yaml.custom instead
# Changes made in preferences.yaml.custom will
# override settings here

style:

  # The resulting style is the combination

  # currently we support:

  #  dseg  # Uses digital segmented font
  #  ghost # really only useful with dseg 
  #  segmented: changes arc/bar gauges to look like individual LEDs
